## Requirements

* Operating System: **Windows 10** Pro 
<!-- or better <sup>(1)</sup>. -->
* [Rhinoceros 3D 6.0](https://www.rhino3d.com/): Focus on Rhino 6.0 only. [See here if you use Rhino 5.0](#rhino-50)
* [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/): 2.7 or 3.x
<!-- * [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/get-started): Download it for [Windows](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows) or [Mac](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac). -->
* Git: [official command-line client](https://git-scm.com/) or visual GUI (e.g. [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/))

<!-- > Note: if you get an error, scroll down to the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section. -->
<sup>(1): Windows 10 Home does not support running Docker.</sup>

<details><summary>Rhino 5.0</summary>
The focus of the workshop will be on Rhino 6.0 only. While most things will work on Rhino 5.0, it is not recommended as there are several manual steps required to get the software to run.

However, if you do use Rhino 5.0, make sure to install the following:
â€‹
* [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/)
* [GHPython](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/ghpython)
* [IronPython 2.7.5](https://github.com/IronLanguages/main/releases/tag/ipy-2.7.5) ([see here for details about this manual update](https://compas-dev.github.io/main/environments/rhino.html#ironpython-1)).

## Getting started

<!-- ![Progress](images/progress-1.png) -->

We will install all the required **COMPAS** packages using Anaconda. Anaconda uses **environments** to create isolated spaces for projects' depedencies, it is recommendable that you do all the exercises in a newly created environment.

First, clone this repository. 
<!-- You have two options: -->
<!-- <details><summary>1. Using a visual client <i>(e.g. SourceTree)</i></summary>
Open your GIT visual client (e.g. SourceTree), and clone the repository (on SourceTree, `File -> Clone / New`) and enter the following URL and the destination folder:

      https://github.com/yijiangh/compas_fab_choreo_workshop.git

</details> -->
<!-- 
<details><summary>2. Using git command line client</summary> -->
Start your Anaconda Prompt, go to the destination folder where you wish to place all the workshop material and run:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yijiangh/compas_fab_choreo_workshop.git
```

<details><summary>If you forget the `--recursive` </summary>

Run the following to update submodules:

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

</details>

<br/>

Now, we can create the environment and install all packages. Start your Anaconda Prompt, go to the repository folder you just cloned, and run:

      conda env create -f workshop.yml -n compas_fab-choreo_workshop
      conda activate compas_fab-choreo_workshop

<details><summary>Not working?</summary>

Make sure you really changed into the repository folder. For example, if you cloned the repository into a folder called `Code` in your home directory, you should type:

**On Mac**

      cd ~/Code/compas_fab_choreo_workshop

**On Windows**

      cd %USERPROFILE%\Code\compas_fab_choreo_workshop

If the command fails because you already have an environment with the same name, choose a different one, or remove the old one before creating the new one:

      conda remove -n workshop --all

</details>

<br/>

Great! Now type `python` in your Anaconda Prompt, and test if the installation went well:

      >>> import compas
      >>> import compas_fab

If that doesn't fail, you're good to go! Exit the python interpreter (either typing `exit()` or pressing `CTRL+Z` followed by `Enter`).

Now let's make all the installed packages available inside Rhino. Still from the Anaconda Prompt, type the following:

      python -m compas_rhino.install -v 6.0 -p compas compas_ghpython compas_rhino compas_fab roslibpy

Congrats! ðŸŽ‰ You are all set! Open Rhino and try to import `compas` to verify everything is working fine.

<!-- ## Setting up your development environment -->
---

## Exercises

### Create an assembly planning instance
```
cd compas_fab.assembly_tests/gh_prototypes/ur_picknplace
```
Open the `ur_picknplace_urdf_export_v0.ghx` in Grasshopper.

### Run semi-constrained Cartesian planning

#### Without ros-backend
```
cd examples
python 0_choreo_picknplace.py
```


#### With ros-backend
```
cd docker/ros-systems/ros-ur5
docker-compose up -d
# after the docker containers are running
cd ../../../examples
# make sure you activate the conda env 'workshop' already
python 0_choreo_picknplace.py -ros
```

## System overview

Environments? Containers? Processes? Confused? ðŸ˜µ What is connected to what and how?

The following diagram shows how the different parts are interconnected and which one calls which other:

## Troubleshooting 

Sometimes things don't go as expected. Here are some of answers to the most common issues you might bump into:

<!-- > Q: Docker does not start. It complains virtualization not enabled in BIOS.

This is vendor specific, depending on the manufacturer of your computer, there are different ways to fix this, but usually, pressing a key (usually `F2` for Lenovo) before Windows even start will take you to the BIOS of your machine. In there, you will find a `Virtualization` tab where this feature can be enabled.

> Q: Cannot start containers, nor do anything with Docker. Error message indicates docker daemon not accessible or no response.

Make sure docker is running. Especially after a fresh install, docker does not start immediately. Go to the start menu, and start `Docker for Windows`. -->

> Q: `conda` commands don't work.

Try running them from the *Conda Prompt*. Depending on how you installed Anaconda, it might not be available by default on the normal Windows command prompt.

> Q: When trying to install the framework in Rhino, it fails indicating the lib folder of IronPython does not exist.

Make sure you have opened Rhino 6 and Grasshopper at least once, so that it finishes setting up all its internal folder structure.

<!-- > Q: It fails when trying to install on Rhino.

Try starting the command prompt as administrator. Depending on the version of Python, it might be required or not.
 -->

> Q: error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required

Follow the link to install Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0

<!-- > Q: IWhen installing pip install compas_fab error: cannot find Frame

You have already installed an older version of COMPAS. Please remove it. -->
